# myIntroNotes.R

# Write your general notes and code experiments into this document. Save it
# from time to time - however I recommend that you do not _commit_
# your saved version.

# This particular script is meant for general notes; each of the key R-scripts
# that we work with will be duplicated separately, so you have "local" versions
# which you should edit with your comments and experiments.

# As long as you do not _commit_ your local scripts to version control,
# you can _pull_ updated versions of the entire project from GitHub
# by using the RStudio version control interface. However, once
# you _commit_ any local file, RStudio will require
# you to resolve conflicts before you can _pull_ updates - because the
# "master" version on GitHub woould otherwise remove your file.
