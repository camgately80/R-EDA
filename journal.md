## Notes:

Write your general notes and code experiments into this document. Save it
from time to time.

Use basic markdown for notes. Put R code in "fenced blocks" with three backticks. You can still execute code with `<select><return>`: Try it:

```
ifelse(runif(1) < 0.5, "You win", "We both win")
```
